## TL;DR:

How a random Twitter reply led me down a minor rabbit hole, where I found what I initially thought was a _centrist pro-stimulus checks botnet_, but may also just be a subculture of centrist Boomer fans of a YouTube show of a rebranded Hollywood gossip, desperate for stimulus money, tweeting under the hashtag #purplepower in very similar bot-like ways.

## Introduction:

So there I was, randomly offering my political opinions in Twitter replies, when I got this response:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-205927.png)

Closely read this odd response I got to my tweet. It seems to have been triggered because I mentioned the "Problem Solvers Caucus" in my reply. While I was wrong that they were the cause in this case as they had proposed a bill which had UI and did not have stimulus checks, the exact opposite of the White House proposal, the response I have gotten criticizes the ~~Problem Solvers~~ "Problem Creators" caucus' bill (not the White House bill), very specifically its lack of stimulus checks and other funding and has a recommended solution(!?) with a link to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyS5JIpqKpk).

Now I got curious, because this account seemed to me like a bot, triggered by the mention of an obscure bipartisan grouping. If this _is_ a botnet, it is the oddest botnet I have ever seen. I decided to look in further.

## Following the links:

I clicked through to [the account](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2), which has follows the [oddest set of accounts](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2/following) (notably, none of the Zoomer accounts I was replying to were included in that assortment) and generally tweets tagging a lot of people very angrily, usually blaming politicians from both parties. There were another two things common to almost all the tweets, which are the hashtags [#PURPLEPOWER](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PURPLEPOWER) and [#LALATE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LALATE).

Here is [one more account](https://twitter.com/dividedwefall78) like this. And [one more](https://twitter.com/SusanMWoodward1). And [another](https://twitter.com/Idamae47414361). And [another](https://twitter.com/Afflictedband20). All tweeting in the same indignant way tagging 5-10 politicians and the two hashtags. Either I have found a centrist political botnet or a YouTube based centrist political subculture.

And now I had three questions:

**_1. What is LA Late?_**

[LA Late](https://news.lalate.com/) looks to be a celebrity gossip site that calls itself "[one of the nation’s most popular news wire services](https://news.lalate.com/about)" (It [isn't, obviously.](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/lalate.com)) The website supposedly has multiple staff, but all of those staff have Twitter accounts that just link articles from the site so this could just be a one-man operation.

It also has an associated [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LALATE/videos) that seemed rather unused with only sporadic updates... until the CARES Act got passed

![rather unused... until the CARES Act got passed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-233148.png)

Nowadays, it is a rather prolific channel that looks like this:

![like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-173319.png)

It has turned into a clickbaity advice content farm initially about getting the funds from the CARES Act and then into a 'news' channel laser-focused on the prospect of a second stimulus bill, fronted by a orange-tinged man who is [probably named Anthony Kling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11743084/). (This is a relatively commonly searched question too)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-233806.png)

Though a channel where every video proclaims that the second stimulus is at hand is rather disturbing, this change has caused it to [gain popularity (especially in states like Oklahoma and West Virginia, probably the states worst hit economically)](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=lalate) and seems [quite lucrative](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/lalatenews/monthly) for the channel. The gossip website itself seems to have been abandoned, with no new posts since September.

**_2. What is 'Purple Power"_**

"Purple Power," as best as I can tell from the videos and tweets, is a name for the viewers of the channel since red (Republicans) + blue (Democrats) together is _Purple_ and powerful. The general tone set by the host ([like in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdtS64UEH8Q)) seems to be that the viewers of the channels are a politically meaningful bloc who actually _have_ influenced politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell who are, in the framing of the host and the subculture, either craven, incompetent, or just plain heartless about the plight of the viewers, who are in dire straits. There is also an element of [shared knowledge](https://twitter.com/sasha3149/status/1325513197256839171?s=20), where the viewers, as guided by the host, have navigated the confusing bureaucracy of the CARES Act and state initiatives to get the money that was theirs. The YouTube popularity that the channel has gained does seem genuine.

**_3. Is this Twitter ‘subculture’ just a botnet?_**

After seeing a video from the channel encouraging its viewers to behave like a swarm on Twitter*,  and this behavior not being much different from the reply-Boomers that quote tweet every article by tagging 10 politicians, I decided to look into whether or not this is an actual botnet by using [Bot Sentinel](https://botsentinel.com/).

First, just to verify whether the tool is accurate, I checked [my account](https://botsentinel.com/profile/2843690641) and the [Neoliberal Twitter account](https://botsentinel.com/profile/865004396681207809#) (both of which are decreed human/normal)

Now to check some of the accounts in this subculture (the ratings are how confident Bot Sentinel is that the account is a bot rated by percentage)

| Account | Bot Rating |
| --- | --- |
| @HopeCoble2 | 45/Questionable |
| @dividedwefall78 | 83/Problematic |
| @susanmwoodward1 | 71/Disruptive |
| @Idamae47414361 | 68/Disruptive |
| @Daniell44384847 | 75/Problematic |
| @afflictedband20 | 95/Problematic |
|||

By this analysis of these accounts and cursory observation of the other accounts using the hashtag, the general behavior of the #purplepower group of accounts is that of a botnet. Most of these were created in past few months and continually spam the same content.Some of the accounts’ rating profile shows a rating history in which the account actually changes from human to bot, most dramatically in the case of @afflictedband20, which seems to be the account of an [actual Christian Metal band](https://www.reverbnation.com/theafflicted2), but is [now seen](https://botsentinel.com/profile/1083566707174711296) as 95% chance of being a bot from 11% chance in the span of 2 months, which means that this account and many of the old accounts in this subculture got hacked for use by botnets.

## The content of the spam and the lessons learnt, if any

The raison d'etre of this spam network seems to be [tweets](https://twitter.com/sasha3149/status/1336363249047113734?s=20) to [pressure politicians](https://twitter.com/Starlovey1Smith/status/1337886108571590657?s=20) to pass a stimulus bill, with links to the LALate channel. There are also many tweets [praising](https://twitter.com/RobinTyrell2/status/1334238724201312257?s=20) the [host of the channel](https://twitter.com/sasha3149/status/1325511937585786881?s=20) as a unifying political leader. 

What has probably happened is that an unsuccesful gossip blogger has got obsessed with stimulus legislation, and has 

\*I am unable to find it now because all the videos look the same and are named similarly and the hashtags on videos on the youtube channel have changed yesterday from #purplepower to #Secondstimuluscheck (which seems to be a change in strategy by the channel). That video talked about something called the “Purple Power Caucus” where the people in the subculture used hashtags and supported each other by liking, following and retweeting each other and tagged politicians to get their attention.
