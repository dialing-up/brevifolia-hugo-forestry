## TL;DR:

How a random Twitter reply led me down a minor rabbit hole, where I found what I initially thought was a _centrist pro-stimulus checks botnet_, but may also just be the Boomer fans of a YouTube show of a Hollywood gossip site desperate for stimulus money, under the hashtag #purplepower

## Introduction:

So there I was, randomly offering my political opinions in Twitter replies, when I got this response:

Read the response I got to my tweet. It seems to have been triggered because I mentioned the "Problem Solvers Caucus." While I was wrong that they were the cause in this case as they had proposed a bill which had UI and did not have stimulus checks, the exact opposite of the White House proposal, the response I have gotten criticizes the ~~Problem Solvers~~ "Problem Creators" caucus' bill, very specifically its lack of stimulus checks and other features and has a recommended solution(!?) with a link to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyS5JIpqKpk).

Now I got curious, because this account seemed to me like a bot, triggered by the mention of an obscure bipartisan grouping. If this is a botnet, it is the oddest botnet I have ever seen. I decided to look in further.
