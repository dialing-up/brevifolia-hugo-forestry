## TL;DR:

How a random Twitter reply led me down a minor rabbit hole, where I found what I initially thought was a _centrist pro-stimulus checks botnet_, but may also just be a subculture of centrist Boomer fans of a YouTube show of a Hollywood gossip site, desperate for stimulus money, tweeting under the hashtag #purplepower in very similar bot-like ways.

## Introduction:

So there I was, randomly offering my political opinions in Twitter replies, when I got this response:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-205927.png)

Closely read this odd response I got to my tweet. It seems to have been triggered because I mentioned the "Problem Solvers Caucus" in my reply. While I was wrong that they were the cause in this case as they had proposed a bill which had UI and did not have stimulus checks, the exact opposite of the White House proposal, the response I have gotten criticizes the ~~Problem Solvers~~ "Problem Creators" caucus' bill (not the White House bill), very specifically its lack of stimulus checks and other funding and has a recommended solution(!?) with a link to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyS5JIpqKpk).

Now I got curious, because this account seemed to me like a bot, triggered by the mention of an obscure bipartisan grouping. If this _is_ a botnet, it is the oddest botnet I have ever seen. I decided to look in further.

## Following the links:

I clicked through to [the account](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2), which has follows the [oddest set of accounts](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2/following) (notably, none of the Zoomer accounts I was replying to were included in that assortment) and generally tweets tagging a lot of people very angrily, usually blaming politicians from both parties. There were another two things common to almost all the tweets, which are the hashtags [#PURPLEPOWER](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PURPLEPOWER) and [#LALATE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LALATE).

Here is [one more account](https://twitter.com/dividedwefall78) like this. And [one more](https://twitter.com/SusanMWoodward1). And [another](https://twitter.com/Idamae47414361). And [another](https://twitter.com/Afflictedband20). All tweeting in the same indignant way tagging 5-10 politicians and the two hashtags. Either I have found a centrist political botnet(!?) or a YouTube based centrist political subculture (!!??)

And now I had three questions:

**_1. What is LA Late?_**

[LA Late](https://news.lalate.com/) seems to be a celebrity gossip/sports site that also has an associated [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LALATE/videos) that seemed rather unused... until the CARES Act got passed

![rather unused... until the CARES Act got passed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-233148.png)

Nowadays, it is a rather prolific channel that looks like this:

![like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-173319.png)

It has turned into a clickbaity advice content farm initially about getting the funds from the CARES Act and then into a 'news' channel laser-focused on the prospect of a second stimulus bill, fronted by a orange-tinged man who is [probably named Anthony Kling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11743084/). (This is a relatively commonly searched question too)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialing-up/brevifolia-hugo-forestry/master/static/images/screenshot-2020-12-12-233806.png)

Though every video proclaiming that the second stimulus is at hand is rather disturbing, this change seems to be [quite lucrative](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/lalatenews/monthly) for the channel.

**_2. What is 'Purple Power"_**

"Purple Power," as best as I can tell from the videos and tweets, is a name for the viewers of the channel since red (Republicans) + blue (Democrats) together is _Purple_ and powerful. The general tone set by the host ([like in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdtS64UEH8Q)) seems to be that the viewers of the channels are a politically meaningful bloc who actually _have_ influenced politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell who are, in the framing of the host and the subculture, either craven, incompetent, or just plain heartless about the plight of the viewers, who are in dire straits. There is also an element of shared knowledge, where the viewers, as guided by the host, have navigated the

**_3. Is the Twitter ‘subculture’ just a botnet?_**

After seeing a video from the channel encouraging its viewers to behave like a swarm on Twitter*,  and this behavior not being much different from the reply-Boomers that quote tweet every article by tagging 10 politicians, I decided to look into whether or not this is an actual botnet by using [Bot Sentinel](https://botsentinel.com/).

First, just to verify whether the tool is accurate, I checked [my account](https://botsentinel.com/profile/2843690641) and the [Neoliberal Twitter account](https://botsentinel.com/profile/865004396681207809#) (both of which are decreed human/normal)

Now to check the accounts in this subculture (the ratings are how confident Bot Sentinel is that the account is a bot rated by percentage)

| Account | Bot Rating |
| --- | --- |
| @HopeCoble2 | 45/Questionable |
| @dividedwefall78 | 83/Problematic |
| @susanmwoodward1 | 71/Disruptive |
| @Idamae47414361 | 68/Disruptive |
| @Daniell44384847 | 75/Problematic |
| @afflictedband20 | 95/Problematic |

By this cursory analysis of these six accounts, the general behavior of the #purplepower group of accounts is that of a botnet. But a closer look at some of the accounts’ rating profile shows a rating history in which the account changes rating  from human to bot, most dramatically in the case of @afflictedband20, which seems to be the account of an [actual Christian Metal band](https://www.reverbnation.com/theafflicted2), but is [now seen](https://botsentinel.com/profile/1083566707174711296) as 95% chance of being a bot from 11% chance in the span of 2 months.

What this means is either that normal accounts got hacked for use by the botnet, or (the disturbing option) that people have changed their social media behavior in desperation for help to such an extent their accounts are not differentiable from bots anymore.

## Lessons learnt, if any

I do not see any way to differentiate whether or not the stimulus-obsessed subculture around the LA Late media property is a human group or a botnet, and from that I have one of two lessons that can be learnt:

1. Botnet harassment is now seen as acceptable against obscure political groupings since social media is seen as the driver of all politics
2. For quite a while now, you could see reply accounts under most popular tweets, begging for donations to their GoFundMes. You could also see the quote-tweets on many news articles where people desperately tag 10-20 politicians to get their attention. This is just another evolution in that behavior, where people, who are being driven to the brink by the lack of a second stimulus see no other option but to behave as a botnet would to get the attention of their politicians.

_None of which seem to bode well for the future_

\*I am unable to find it now because all the videos look the same and are named similarly and the hashtags on videos on the youtube channel have changed yesterday from #purplepower to #Secondstimuluscheck (which seems to be a change in strategy by the channel). That video talked about something called the “Purple Power Caucus” where the people in the subculture used hashtags and supported each other by liking, following and retweeting each other and tagged politicians to get their attention.
