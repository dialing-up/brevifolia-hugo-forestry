## TL;DR:

How a random Twitter reply led me down a minor rabbit hole, where I found what I initially thought was a _centrist pro-stimulus checks botnet_, but may also just be the centrist Boomer fans of a YouTube show of a Hollywood gossip site, desperate for stimulus money, tweeting under the hashtag #purplepower in very similar bot-like ways.

## Introduction:

So there I was, randomly offering my political opinions in Twitter replies, when I got this response:

Closely read this odd response I got to my tweet. It seems to have been triggered because I mentioned the "Problem Solvers Caucus." While I was wrong that they were the cause in this case as they had proposed a bill which had UI and did not have stimulus checks, the exact opposite of the White House proposal, the response I have gotten criticizes the ~~Problem Solvers~~ "Problem Creators" caucus' bill (not the White House bill), very specifically its lack of stimulus checks and other features and has a recommended solution(!?) with a link to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyS5JIpqKpk).

Now I got curious, because this account seemed to me like a bot, triggered by the mention of an obscure bipartisan grouping. If this _is_ a botnet, it is the oddest botnet I have ever seen. I decided to look in further.

## Following the links:

I clicked through to [the account](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2), which has follows the [oddest set of accounts](https://twitter.com/HopeCoble2/following) (notably, none of the Zoomer accounts I was replying to were included in that assortment) and generally tweets tagging a lot of people very angrily, generally blaming politicians from both parties. There were another two things common to almost all the tweets, which are the hashtags [#PURPLEPOWER](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PURPLEPOWER) and [#LALATE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LALATE).

Here is [one more account](https://twitter.com/dividedwefall78) like this. And [one more](https://twitter.com/SusanMWoodward1). And [another](https://twitter.com/Idamae47414361). And [another](https://twitter.com/Afflictedband20). All tweeting in the same indignant way tagging 5-10 politicians and the two hashtags. Either I have found a centrist political botnet(!?) or a YouTube based centrist political subculture (!!??)

And now I had three questions:

**_1. What is LA Late?_**

[LA Late](https://news.lalate.com/) seems to be a celebrity gossip/sports site that also has an associated [YouTube channel]() that seemed rather unused... until the CARES Act got passed

Nowadays, it is a rather prolific channel that looks like this:

It has turned into a clickbaity content farm solely focused on the prospect of a second stimulus bill, fronted by a orange-tinged man who is [probably named Anthony Kling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11743084/). It seems like this is a relatively commonly searched question too:
